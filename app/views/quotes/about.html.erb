  <h1>About Splurty</h1>

  <p>
    Splurty went live on the 28th of June, 2014 as part of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firehoseweekend.com/">Firehose Weekend</a>. Born of the need to bestow the best of my 20+ years of student experiences unto the next generation of green students, Splurty also served as my playground to re-learn web development after college.

  <p>
    The site is built on the <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework with a postgres database and <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a> being used to make it look slick on mobile as well as other devices. Big shoutout to <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/MarcoMorawec">Marco</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/KenMazaika">Ken</a> for being awesome and guiding me through this. I'd highly recommended their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firehoseweekend.com/">courses</a> if you're looking to get kickstarted on web development.

    <p>
      Amitav Khandelwal is a tech/biz hybrid who likes to taste what's cooking in the next wave of technology, even if his tongue does get a little singed in the process. He likes hacking at his next Android app, building websites like this one and meeting people around Boston, among other things like <i>trying</i> to stay fit and making futile attempts at juggling.
