    Splurty went live on the 28th of June, 2014 as part of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firehoseweekend.com/">Firehose Weekend</a>. Born of the need to bestow the best of my 20+ years of student experiences unto the next generation of green students, Splurty also served as my playground to re-learn web development after college.

    The site is built on the <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework with a postgres database. <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a> was used to make it look slick. Big shoutout to <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/MarcoMorawec">Marco</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/KenMazaika">Ken</a> for being awesome and guiding me through this. I'd highly recommended their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firehoseweekend.com/">courses</a> if you're looking to get kickstarted on web development.
