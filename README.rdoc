Splurty went live on the 28th of June, 2014 as part of a Firehose Weekend. Born of the need to bestow the best of my 20+ years of student experiences unto the next generation of green students, Splurty also served as my playground to re-learn web development after college.


The site is built on the Ruby on Rails framework with a postgres database. Bootstrap 3 was used to make it look slick. Big shoutout to Marco & Ken for being awesome and guiding me through this. I'd highly recommended their courses if you're looking to get kickstarted on web development.
